The functions I made:
openServerSocketConnection - Gets a port number and open a socket connection for the server. Return the serverFD if succeeded, or -1(=ERROR) if failed.
startServerRun - Simulates the server runtime. It goes on an endless loop and checks either a client tries to connect to it, to disconnect from it or 					 send information through it to the other connected clients.
createNewConnection - Creates a new connection with a new client. Return the new max number of connections.
readLine - Checks if a connection is terminated or trying to send information to the other clients, and acts according to the needed operation.
