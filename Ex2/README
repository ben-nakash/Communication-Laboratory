	Makefile
	README	- Readme file with description of the contents & personal functions within the exercise.
	ex2.c - Implications of the functions located in the header file.
	ex2.h - Definitions of the structs, functions and consts. 
The functions I made:
	fileRead - Extracts vertices & edges from a given file and creates a Graph to hold them. Return null if failed.
	createEdge - Gets 2 vertices & weight, create an edge and adding it to a given graph. Return null if failed.
	createGraph - Gets number of vertices & edges and create a graph struct. If failed return null.
	createVertex - Gets a name and create a new Vertex. Return vertex if success or null if failed.
	addVertexToGraph - Adding a vertex to a graph. If it already exist, it returns a pointer to the existed one.
	addEdgeToGraph - Adding an edge to a graph. If its already exists it frees the new one.
	freeVertex - free the allocated memory of a given vertex.
	freeEdge - free the allocated memory of a given edge.
	freeGraph - free the allocated memory of a given graph.
	printGraph - prints out the graph in the following format: dst via distance.
	bellmanFord - Bellman ford algorithm.
