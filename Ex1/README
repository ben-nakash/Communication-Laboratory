A few personal functions I made:
	getHashVal - Gets table & data pointers, returns the hash value of the data or -1 if there's error.
	addToList  - Gets table, object and index. Adds the data to a list according to the index. Return -1 if there's an error or the index if ok.
	enlargeTable - gets a table pointer and doubling it's size. If there's error it returns -1, else it returns 0.
